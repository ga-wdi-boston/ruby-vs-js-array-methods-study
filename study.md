# Ruby vs JavaScript Array Methods Study

Use your favorite search engine and any other resources to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source

Use `grunt test` to test your code.


## FIBONACCI

In `bin/fibonacci.js` please write the following:
1. `sumFibs`. Use reduce to find the sum of the `fibs` array.

2. `prodFibs`. Use array methods to find the product of the `fibs` array,
    not including 0.
3. `sumOdd`. Use array methods to find the sum of the odd numbers in the
    `fibs` array.
4. `prodEven`. Use array methods to find the product of the even numbers in the
    `fibs` array, not including 0.


What were some similarities and differences between the Ruby and JS array methods?

```md
The similarities between the two are that they are used by separating the array in question with a period. You can also chain them both. The difference lies with the syntax in Ruby which doesn't require parentheses. In my opinion it seems like you have to do a lot more work in JS to get things to happen to every element of an array. I also find the documentation for methods in Ruby far easier to decipher.

## COMPARE: JS vs Ruby file reading

Look at the functions in `people.js` and `people.rb`. Both of these functions do
the same thing: they parse a csv file and enter the pertinent data into an array.
Explain the similarities and differences between these two funtions.

```md
Well to start with the obvious, there is the size difference in the files. The JS one is much smaller. The JS one also deals with promises which means it can handle multiple pieces of data using the stack (I think). There is not a lot of content that I can pick up on in the JS method just makes sense as a human reading code. I get some of it because of my newfound JS abilities, but most of it is still gibberish. The Ruby file is a bit more readable but not by much. However, it is a bit easier to parse from a human perspective and given my current knowledge base is a lot more readable.
```

## PEOPLE COUNT

In `lib/people-array.js`, write a function `women` that will count the number of
women in an array of people.
What are the differences between this function and the ruby funcion we did
in class?

```md
Similar to the previous answers. I feel a lot more confident in my ability to use Ruby as opposed to JS. While the functions do the same thing, the Ruby syntax is far easier to pick up on.
