# Ruby vs JavaScript Array Methods Study

Use your favorite search engine and any other resources to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

Use `grunt test` to test your code.


## FIBONACCI

In `bin/fibonacci.js` please write the following:
1. `sumFibs`. Use reduce to find the sum of the `fibs` array.
2. `prodFibs`. Use array methods to find the product of the `fibs` array,
    not including 0.
3. `sumOdd`. Use array methods to find the sum of the odd numbers in the
    `fibs` array.
4. `prodEven`. Use array methods to find the product of the even numbers in the
    `fibs` array, not including 0.


What were some similarities and differences between the Ruby and JS array methods?

```md
I would say a difference would be in ruby you can just use a method without having
to later call it in a function as in javascript. However both have the syntax
with dot .<name of function here>
Tried writing methods for awhile but couldn't get to run fibonacci.js.
```

## COMPARE: JS vs Ruby file reading

Look at the functions in `people.js` and `people.rb`. Both of these functions do
the same thing: they parse a csv file and enter the pertinent data into an array.
Explain the similarities and differences between these two funtions.

```md
interstingly it doesn't look like the js file requires the csv file like the ruby file does.
Both ruby and JS look for the people array.
Both seem to use new.
```

## PEOPLE COUNT

In `lib/people-array.js`, write a function `women` that will count the number of
women in an array of people.
What are the differences between this function and the ruby funcion we did
in class?

```md
let women = people.filter(function(x){return x==women}).length
you had to first define the variable then set it to the array of people with a method to
filter , unlike in ruby where you could just use methods on an array from the start
without necessarily having to use a function and a variable.
```
