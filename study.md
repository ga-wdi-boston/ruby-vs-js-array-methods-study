# Ruby vs JavaScript Array Methods Study

Use your favorite search engine and any other resources to research and

Use `grunt test` to test your code.


## FIBONACCI

In `bin/fibonacci.js` please write the following:
1. `sumFibs`. Use reduce to find the sum of the `fibs` array.
2. `prodFibs`. Use array methods to find the product of the `fibs` array,
    not including 0.
3. `sumOdd`. Use array methods to find the sum of the odd numbers in the
    `fibs` array.
4. `prodEven`. Use array methods to find the product of the even numbers in the
    `fibs` array, not including 0.


What were some similarities and differences between the Ruby and JS array methods?

```md
Many of the methods have the same name and proform similar actions. there are far more moethods in ruby. The syntax in ruby is a little different.
```

## COMPARE: JS vs Ruby file reading

Look at the functions in `people.js` and `people.rb`. Both of these functions do
the same thing: they parse a csv file and enter the pertinent data into an array.
Explain the similarities and differences between these two funtions.

```md
They both are need to require files but they do so in different places and in different ways. The ruby version is much shorter.
```

## PEOPLE COUNT

In `lib/people-array.js`, write a function `women` that will count the number of
women in an array of people.
What are the differences between this function and the ruby funcion we did
in class?

```md
The ruby function was far easier to write......
```
