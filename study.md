# Ruby vs JavaScript Array Methods Study

Use your favorite search engine and any other resources to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

Use `grunt test` to test your code.


## FIBONACCI

In `lib/fibonacci.js` please write the following in **_JavaScript_**:
1. `sumFibs`. Use reduce to find the sum of the `fibs` array.
2. `prodFibs`. Use array methods to find the product of the `fibs` array,
    not including 0.
3. `sumOdd`. Use array methods to find the sum of the odd numbers in the
    `fibs` array.
4. `prodEven`. Use array methods to find the product of the even numbers in the
    `fibs` array, not including 0.

    **Note:** `sumFibs`, `prodFibs`, `sumOdd`, and `prodEven` should be variables that store the result of invoking array methods on the `fibs` array, and not the methods themselves.


What were some similarities and differences between the Ruby and JS array methods?

```md
Both the Ruby and JS methods iterate over the fibonacci array and both of them work the same way.  Ruby is different than JS in that it uses blocks of code for logic and uses array functions or blocks rather than for loops to iterate.
```

## COMPARE: JS vs Ruby file reading

Look at the functions in `people.js` and `people.rb`. Both of these functions do
the same thing: they parse a csv file and enter the pertinent data into an array.
Explain the similarities and differences between these two functions.

```md
JS uses a parser and a stream to read through the data while passing it to the array.  It iterates using a while loop.  Ruby uses a class to contain the data and uses a foreach to iterate through the data.
```

## PEOPLE COUNT

In `lib/people-array.js`, write a function `women` that will count the number of
women in an array of people.
What are the differences between this function and the ruby function we did
in class?

```md
In JS, the functions use for loops to iterate rather than blocks.  In addition, JS uses premade functions as callbacks in reduce.  In Ruby, we use blocks of code rather than premade functions which are usually only used on that particular reduce call.
```
