# Ruby vs JavaScript Array Methods Study

Use your favorite search engine and any other resources to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

Use `grunt test` to test your code.


## FIBONACCI

In `bin/fibonacci.js` please write the following:
1. `sumFibs`. Use reduce to find the sum of the `fibs` array.
2. `prodFibs`. Use array methods to find the product of the `fibs` array,
    not including 0.
3. `sumOdd`. Use array methods to find the sum of the odd numbers in the
    `fibs` array.
4. `prodEven`. Use array methods to find the product of the even numbers in the
    `fibs` array, not including 0.


What were some similarities and differences between the Ruby and JS array methods?

```md
I mean, they do the same thing, I get that.  They go through an array and return the value
that you specify.  JS is so confusing to me!  Ruby makes so much more sense.  If we could just not do any more JS, that would ok.  I vote for that.  I will continue to improve my JS, because it's
annoying me that I don't get it and it makes me want to try and get it even more.  AHHHH!  Javascript.  Boo.
```

## COMPARE: JS vs Ruby file reading

Look at the functions in `people.js` and `people.rb`. Both of these functions do
the same thing: they parse a csv file and enter the pertinent data into an array.
Explain the similarities and differences between these two funtions.

```md
The Ruby file seems more succinct, the built in methods help to shrink down the need to write
code, which is nice.  These are actually very good examples of why Ruby makes more sense to me.  I also enjoy the lack of {()};; etc. JS has so many compared to Ruby, looking at the page it's easy to get lost in
punctuation.
```

## PEOPLE COUNT

In `lib/people-array.js`, write a function `women` that will count the number of
women in an array of people.
What are the differences between this function and the ruby funcion we did
in class?

```md
Again, it does the same things, it's just harder to read/write to me.  And it's more writing.
```
